# Study-Buddies-Open
Open sourced code of my Study Buddies Webapp
Check out the website! https://studybudds.com/

Please note that this repo is still seperate from my private repo. The website still currently uses the private repo. This is route I chose to take because it minimizes the potential data loss I could have from rebasing. However, all the major changes and tests will be done on this repo and eventually moved over to the private repo (Guarnteed) All the code here is exactly the same as my private repo minus my sensitive credentials. Think of it as the development repo. 

Thanks again for all the support!
